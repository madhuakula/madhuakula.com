abstract = """
In this talk will focus on two different perspectives of container security. We will see, how attackers can break into docker container and kubernetes clusters to gain access, escalate privileges to infrastructure by using misconfigurations and application security vulnerabilities. Also, we can see how defenders can leverage the power of automation at different layers like Infrastructure Security, Supply chain Security and Run time Security to protect against the container security attacks.
 
By the end of this talk participants able to use this knowledge to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in applications running on containers inside kubernetes clusters. Also, it will be useful to apply pragmatic security using tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to secure the container infrastructure.
