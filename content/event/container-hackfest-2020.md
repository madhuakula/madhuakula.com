Trend Micro and Benchmark bring you Container Hackfest, a 1 hour online event where certified offensive hackers attempt to break a container environment protected by Trend Micro Cloud One Security and Benchmark.

Hackers will try to break into applications running on GCP Kubernetes services and deface infrastructure by using a series of techniques common in attacks today. Defending the applications, we have Trend Micro Application Security protecting against OWASP top 10 runtime threats and Trend Micro Cloud One Workload Security protecting managed workloads from zero-day threats, unpatched vulnerabilities, IoA (MITRE ATT&CK framework) and more.
