abstract = """
Monitoring for application attacks and defending them in real-time is crucial. Crunch through all the logs from the various sources (web servers, applications, waf etc.) to gain insights from anomalies in real time. Making the right choices from the attacks can prove to be a nightmare. Even with the solutions already available in the market.

In this training we can see attacks happening in real time using a centralised dashboard. By collecting logs from various sources we will monitor and analyse the attacks. Using data gleaned from the logs, we can apply defensive rules against the attackers. We will be using open source technologies to build this monitoring solution.

Training attendees will receive a comprehensive walk-through E-book, Ansible Playbooks, custom scripts and best practices check-lists.
