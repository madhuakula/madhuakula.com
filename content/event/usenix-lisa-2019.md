abstract = """
An organization using micro services or any other distributed architecture rely heavily on containers and orchestration engines like Kubernetes and as such its infrastructure security is paramount to its business operations. In this training we will use open source tools, techniques and procedures (TTP's) to build secure container infrastructure, which means we will perform security at many layers like infrastructure security, supply chain security and run-time security with real-world scenarios. The outcome of this workshop can be directly applied in their organizations and daily operations to apply practical security skills in the modern era using open source.
