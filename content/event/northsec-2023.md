abstract = """
Containers and Kubernetes are everywhere. The adoption of Kubernetes use in production has increased to 83% from a survey by CNCF. Still, most security teams struggle to understand these modern technologies.

In this training, we will learn tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). We will start with understanding architecture and its attack surface. Then we will dive into each layer of security starting from the supply chain, infrastructure, runtime, and many others. From an attackerâ€™s perspective participants can assess and attack Kubernetes Cluster environments to gain access to microservices, sensitive data, escaping containers, escalating to clusters privileges, and even its underlying cloud environments.
