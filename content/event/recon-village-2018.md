abstract = """
Reconnaissance is about gathering information. The information gathered is only as good as the insights and actionable decisions that we can gain from it. A lot of research is focused on finding OSINT data but little is done towards converting the data into insights and actionable decisions. Visualisation is an easy and efficient way to gain insights from any the data gleaned.

In this workshop, we will look at how we can gather OSINT data and visualise it using free and open source solutions. Visualising data is not enough, we’ll also look at how we can use the metrics to answer business questions and lead to actionable decisions.

**We’ll tackle the problem by breaking it into following steps**

* Gathering OSINT data
* Storing the OSINT data
* Processing & visualising the data
* Gaining insights and making actionable decisions

**Some specific use-cases we’ll look at during the workshop includes**

* Monitoring an organisation’s SSL/TLS certificates, domains and subdomains in near-real time
* Creating dashboards using public datasets(scans.io) to gain insights into an organisation’s external posture
* Building monitoring and alerting solutions using OSINT data that will help us take business decisions

**Participants will get**

* Step by Step Gitbook covering the entire training (html, pdf, epub, mobi)
* Custom scripts, playbooks and tools used as part of the workshop
* Scenarios that can be readily implemented for your use cases
* References to the data used in the workshop”
