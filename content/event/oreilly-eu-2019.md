abstract = """
Developer and Operation teams (DevOps) have moved towards cloud, containers, kubernetes, serverless and cloud native infrastructure. Security teams are still catching up with understanding these technologies and applying their knowledge of security expertise. As we work with modern technologies to build our organizations infrastructure, we prefer to make the application available in production as soon and as many times as possible. In this workshop, we will get started with setting up real-world cloud native infrastructure using containers, serverless, service mesh with automated deployments and each phase will contain built-in security with help opensource tools and cloud services.

We will perform security at multiple layers like Infrastructure Security, Supply chain Security and Run time Security with real-world scenarios. At the end of the workshop we will verify the security of the cloud native infrastructure by performing automated security scan with the help of CIS Benchmarks. The outcome of this workshop can be directly applied in their organizations and daily operations to apply practical security skills in the modern era.

**Some of the interesting real-world scenarios we will be covering during the training includes:**

* Secure infrastructure setup using ingress controller, OAuth2 proxy and cert-manager
* Near real-time security defense of micro services and APIs using Istio (Service Mesh)
* Runtime container security monitoring using Sysdig Faclo to detect and defend against security attacks

*Note: We will be deploying mostly in Goolge Cloud Platform (GCP), but all the scenarios and concepts will be applied in different cloud providers and on-premise environments.*
