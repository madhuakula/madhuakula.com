I think most you have heard of the term "containers". In this puliya session we will learn what, where and how to use containers. Eventually using it to do security automation. Containers can be really powerful and in several cases can be used to setup and run entire an infrastructure in a matter of seconds.

We will be using Docker to understand container technology. Docker is a tool specially crafted for both developers and administrators. It helps everyone to become productive as soon as possible, by fitting into everyone's primary tool set.

We will start with discussing basics to running multiple applications and service in containers using utilities like docker, docker-compose etc.

This puliya session can be applied in everyday life including office work, personal projects and many more. We will also look at various use cases to automate work flows like system administration, developer automation, security tools automation etc.
