abstract = """
An organization using micro services or any other distributed architecture rely heavily on containers and orchestration engines like Kubernetes and as such its infrastructure security is paramount to its business operations. This workshop will focus on how attackers can break into docker container and Kubernetes clusters to gain access, escalate privileges to infrastructure by using misconfigurations and application security vulnerabilities. Trainer will share examples of real world security issues found in penetration testing engagements to showcase mapping of the attack usually happens in the real world.

By the end of workshop participants will be able to:

* Understand Docker and Kubernetes security architecture
* Attack & Audit containerised infrastructure for security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
* Learn from these scenarios how they can assess their environments and fix them before attackers gain control over their modern infrastructure
* Learn commonly used tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for cloud native infrastructure

Prerequisites:

* Basic knowledge of using the Linux command line
* System administration basics like servers, applications configuration and deployment

Familiarity with container environments like Docker would be useful

Materials:

* GCP free trail account (https://cloud.google.com/free)
* A laptop with administrator privileges
* At least 8GB of RAM, 10GB of Disk space free on the system for VM
* Laptop should support hardware-based virtualization, Install Oracle - VirtualBox 6.x and verify it can run a 64-bit operating system. (Other virtualization software might work but we will not be able to provide support for that.)
* USB Ports for copying VM and course content (docs, scripts, etc.)
