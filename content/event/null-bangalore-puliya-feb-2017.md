abstract = """
Most of us are excellent at doing things, but when it comes to documentation it's one of the boring tasks ever in life. This workshop is primarily focused on how can we automate writing awesome documentation, creating presentations and building knowledge base using Markdown. We will also see some useful tips & tricks to version control everything and building ubercool ebooks using GitBooks.

This entire workshop content can be applied in everyday life including office work, personal projects, many more. We will also look at various tools to automate the workflows like Sublime Text and Plug-ins, reveal-md, Raneto, etc.
