abstract = """
Monitoring for attacks and defending them in real-time is crucial. Crunch through all the logs from the various sources (servers, applications, firewalls etc.) to gain insights from anomalies in real time. Making the right choices from the attacks can prove to be a nightmare. Even with the solutions already available in the market.
In this workshop we can see attacks happening in real time using a centralised dashboard. By collecting logs from various sources we will monitor and analyse the attacks. Using data gleaned from the logs, we can apply defensive rules against the attackers automatically.

We will be using open source technologies to build this monitoring solution. We will be showcasing this against AWS and Azure infrastructure
