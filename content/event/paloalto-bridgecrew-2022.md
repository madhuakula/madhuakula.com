abstract = """
Kubernetes Cluster environment to practice and learn about Kubernetes Security.

In this session, Madhu Akula will present the latest version of the Kubernetes Goat by exploring different vulnerabilities in Kubernetes Cluster and Containerised environments. Also, he demonstrates the real-world vulnerabilities and maps the Kubernetes Goat scenarios with them. As a defender you will see how we can learn these attacks, misconfigurations to understand and improve your cloud native infrastructure security posture.

We see a ton of newly added vulnerabilities, CVEs and mapping with some opensource security tools to perform from writing developer code to deploying into production security using different layers like Infrastructure security, Supply chain security, Runtime security.
