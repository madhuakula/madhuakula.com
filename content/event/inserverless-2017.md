abstract = """
Monitoring for attacks and defending them in real-time is crucial. Making the right choices during attacks can prove to be a nightmare even with the solutions already available in the market. In this talk we will see how an automated defence system powered by Serverless can be used to block attacks against our cloud infrastructure. By collecting logs from various sources we will monitor, analyse and act by applying defensive rules against attackers automatically. We will use AWS for managing and securing the infrastructure discussed in our talk.
