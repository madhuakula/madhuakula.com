abstract = """
For most network engineers who monitor the perimeter for malicious content, it is very important to respond to an imminent threat originating from outside the boundaries of their network. Having to crunch through all the logs that the various devices (firewalls, routers, security appliances etc.) spit out, correlating that data and in real time making the right choices can prove to be a nightmare. Even with the solutions already available in the market. In this workshop we will create a space for interested folks to design, build, customise and deploy their very own FOSS based centralised visual attack monitoring dashboard. This setup will be able to perform real time analysis using the trusted ELK stack and visually denote what popular attack hotspots exist on a network.
