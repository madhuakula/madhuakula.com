abstract = """
The adoption of Kubernetes use in production has increased to 83% from a survey by CNCF. Still, most security teams struggle to understand these modern technologies.

In this real-world scenario-based training, each participant will be learning Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to attack and assess Kubernetes clusters environments at different layers like Supply chain, Infrastructure, Runtime, and many others. Starting from simple recon to gaining access to microservices, sensitive data, escaping containers, escalating to clusters privileges, and even its underlying cloud environments.

By end of the training, participants will be able to apply their knowledge to perform architecture reviews, security assessments, red team exercises, and pen-testing engagements on Kubernetes Clusters and Containerized environments successfully.  Also, the trainer will provide step by step guide (Digital Book) with resources and references to further your learning.
