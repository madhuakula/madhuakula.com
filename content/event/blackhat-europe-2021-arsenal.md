abstract = """
Kubernetes Goat is a "vulnerable by design" Kubernetes Cluster environment to practice and learn about Kubernetes Security. It has step by step detailed guide and digital book on how to get started with Kubernetes Goat by exploring different vulnerabilities in Kubernetes Cluster and Containerized environments. Also, it has scenarios taken from the real-world vulnerabilities and maps the Kubernetes Goat scenarios. The complete documentation and instruction to practice Kubernetes Security for performing security assessments, pentesting, and in general Kubernetes Security. As a defender you will see how we can learn these attacks, misconfigurations to understand and improve your cloud-native infrastructure security posture.
