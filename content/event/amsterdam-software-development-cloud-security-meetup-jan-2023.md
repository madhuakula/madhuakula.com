abstract = """
Kubernetes become the defacto for deploying and managing applications from startups to enterprises. This means most developers start writing their application code, package them into containers and deploy them into clusters to serve the customers. But if you look at typical day-to-day development and operations from local development to production deployment, we perform a ton of things that can be potentially insecure patterns. As we use modern tools, and technologies we tend to forget to secure them while building and serving our customers. In this talk, we will see how we can secure Kubernetes workflows and how we can automate these security checks and validate them to identify potential security risks before deploying our applications and code into production.

Madhu Akula will be using Kubernetes Goat, an interactive Kubernetes security learning playground in this talk to demonstrate some security concerns and fix them live ðŸš€
