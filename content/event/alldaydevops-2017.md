abstract = """
We will discuss the what, why and the how of running modern security operations. We will take a look at the pain points in a DevOps life cycle and see the benefits of pragmatic security solutions. Attendees will get an idea about where and how to start devsecops for secure devops pipeline.

This talk is focused on the what, why and the how of running security operations in the modern world. The way attacks are changing and developers are moving ahead with the next generation technologies is blazingly fast. However, traditional operations still exist. It then becomes imperative to make changes in the way security operations should run to defend against attackers and work with developers and modern businesses. In this talk, we will see what are the real world problems faced by organisations, how we can rapidly adapt to changes by modifying the culture and methodologies while relying on processes, tools and techniques.
