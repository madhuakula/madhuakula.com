abstract = """
Developers and Operations teams (DevOps) have moved towards containers and modern technologies. Attackers are catching up with these technologies and finding security flaws in them. In this workshop, we will look at how we can test for security issues and vulnerabilities in Dockerised environments . Throughout the workshop we will learn how we can find security misconfigurations, insecure defaults and container escape techniques to gain access to host operating system (or) clusters. In the workshop, we will look at real world scenarios where attackers compromised containers to gain the access to applications, data and other assets.

By the end of workshop participants will be able to:

* Understand Docker security architecture
* Audit containerised environments
* Perform container escapes to get access to host environments

The participants will get the following:

* A Gitbook(pdf, epub, mobi) with complete workshop content
* Virtual machines to learn & practice
* Other references to learn more about topics covered in the workshop

### Who should attend: 

* Penetration Testers
* Security Engineers/Analysts
* IT and System Administrators
* DevOps and Security Teams

### Take back to work: 

* A Gitbook(pdf, epub, mobi) with complete workshop content
* Virtual machines to learn & practice
* Other references to learn more about topics covered in the workshop

### Topics include: 

Docker, Containers, Security, Audit, DevSecOps, SecOps

### Prerequisites: 
* Able to run linux cli commands
* Basics of system administration
* Understanding about virutalisation would be useful
* A laptop with administrator privileges
* 10 GB of free Hard Disk Space
* Ideally 8 GB of RAM but minimum 4 GB
* Laptop should support hardware-based virtualization
    * If your laptop can run a 64-bit virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox it should work
    * Other virtualisation software might work but we will not be able to provide support for that.
