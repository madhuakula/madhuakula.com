abstract = """
While developers, operators and enterprises are adopting containers, security is still considered as one of the prime challenges in container utilisation - According to a survey conducted by Forrester 43% of the enterprises reported that their biggest concern to container utilisation is security.

Developers and Operations teams (DevOps) have moved to containers because it makes it easy to build, package and promote an application along with all its dependencies. As the technology advances, so are the attackerâ€™s methodologies to catch up the security flaws.

In this webinar by Madhu Akula you will learn the security techniques on container configurations, exposures, vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations & monitoring containerise applications using Open Source Solutions. Container security is the protection to maintain the integrity of containers and is a continuous process which should be followed by the users.  You can discuss your real-world scenarios and gain insights to secure your container assets.
