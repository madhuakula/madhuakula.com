abstract = """
In this session Madhu Akula will give his first public introduction to Kubernetes Goat, designed to be an intentionally vulnerable cluster environment to learn and practice Kubernetes security. Madhu will present how to get started with Kubernetes Goat by exploring different vulnerabilities in Kubernetes Cluster and Containerized environments.

Also, we will see the complete documentation and instruction to practice Kubernetes Security for performing security assessments. Also, as a defender we will see how we can learn these attacks, misconfigurations to understand and improve your cloud native infrastructure security posture.

Feel free to check out the project at https://github.com/madhuakula/kubernetes-goat
