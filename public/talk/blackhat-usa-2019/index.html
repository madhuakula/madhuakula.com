<p>During the training, you will be able to orchestrate and see the automated response work for the following scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Scenarios</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SSH Brute-force attacks detection &amp; automated defense</li>
<li>Popular CMS attack detection and automated analysis for further audit</li>
<li>Parsing VPC flow logs to defend against network attacks in AWS cloud services</li>
<li>AWS IAM CloudTrail logs to detect and defend against backdoors planted by attackers</li>
<li>Container logs to detect and offer automated response in real time for attacks against Kubernetes clusters in GCP</li>
<li>Automated Security Compliance using cloud native tools such as AWS Config and open source tool such as Cloud Custodian</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Take Aways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Real-world scenarios where we show how to foil attackers using security orchestration and automated response across cloud providers such as AWS, Azure and GCP</li>
<li>Ebooks of the training covering all hands-on in a step by step guide (HTML, PDF, EPub, Mobi)</li>
<li>Git repository of all the custom source code, scripts, playbooks used during the training</li>
<li>Approaches on how to tailor automated response solutions for the cloud provider you work with</li>
<li>Orchestration, provisioning playbooks, scripts for setting up the entire cloud infrastructure used for the training labs which includes Terraform, Packer and Ansible</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some of the topics and techniques covered will include (at a minimum):</strong></p>

<p>We start day one by setting the stage for automated response by deploying a centralized monitoring &amp; alerting system</p>

<ul>
<li>Environment setup for defenders to work with the training labs</li>
<li>Setting up hardened Elastic Stack using Ansible playbooks and Terraform</li>
<li>Configuring cloud infrastructure to send logs to centralized monitoring system</li>
<li>Attack patterns analysis and detection</li>
<li>Building attack monitoring dashboards</li>
<li>Setting up near real-time alerts (slack, email, etc.)</li>
<li>SSH brute-force attack and security response against infrastructure</li>
<li>Building security dashboards for further analysis</li>
<li>Detecting the attack and applying real-time defense using automated response</li>
<li>CMS attack detection and automated analysis for further audit</li>
<li>Attack audit analysis using security dashboards</li>
</ul>

<p>We will focus on day two by adding a Serverless stack to defend against the cloud infrastructure based on the near real-time alerts to match DevOps speed</p>

<ul>
<li>Deploying the automated defense</li>
<li>Setting up monitoring system AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail logs</li>
<li>Attacking internal services hosted inside the AWS Virtual Private Cloud Service (VPC)</li>
<li>Detecting internal attacks against cloud services using AWS Flow Logs</li>
<li>Applying defense for attacks against cloud services</li>
<li>Abusing metadata and gaining access to compromised AWS IAM keys for users and roles</li>
<li>Identifying compromised IAM keys usage using AWS CloudTrail logs</li>
<li>Defending against IAM compromised keys using Serverless (AWS Lambda)</li>
<li>Setting up automated Kubernetes infrastructure with services</li>
<li>Monitoring Kubernetes security events for attacks</li>
<li>Attacking containerized applications in Kubernetes</li>
<li>Near real-time automated defense against Docker container security attacks</li>
<li>Automated compliance using AWS Config and Cloud Custodian</li>
</ul>
